# URLColors
Chrome Extension to highlight the body of a webpage with colored border for URL's that match user settings.

This extension allows you to flag specified websites by highlighting the website with a colored border.  This is especially useful for developers who run their web applications on many different environments and who are constantly switching between a dev, test, and production version of an app or database.  Because the application may look the same on all environments, it's easy to accidentally do something on the production environment that shouldn't have been done.  

With URLColors, you can easily have the browser flag important websites for you by specifying a the keyword to match against the tab url, the border color, width, whether or not the border should blink, and the interval of blinking.
